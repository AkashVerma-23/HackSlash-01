This project is based on a game named "Simon Says", build by using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
This game is a popular memory challenge where players must repeat a sequence of colors and clicks the color in the correct order.

Game Initialization:
When the game starts, the system generates a random sequence of colored buttons lighting up in a specific order.Each button corresponds to a unique color.

User Interaction:
The player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
If the player clicks the correct sequence, the game advances to the next level, adding an extra step to the sequence.
If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends or prompts a retry,and shows a red color in background.

Increasing Difficulty:
Each round increases the length of the sequence, making it harder to memorize.
The player must rely on their memory and concentration to keep up with the growing pattern.

It enhances logical thinking by challenging the memory.
It demonstrates event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
It is a fun and interactive way to improve web development skills.
